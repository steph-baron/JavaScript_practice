/* The user will be able to input a question
then the program will output a random fortune for the user */

## First step is to create a variable userName set to an empty string.

## Below the variable create a ternary expression that decides what to do if the user enters a name or not
## If a name is entered, use string interpolation to log "Hello, userName!"

## Second step is to create a second variable userQuestion
## The value of the variable will be a string that is the question the user wants to ask the Magic Eight Ball

## Third step is to create a third variable randomNumber which will generate a random whole integer between 0 and 8.

## Fourth step is to create a fourth variable eightBall, set it equal to an empty string. The value of this variable will be determined by randomNumber variable.

## Fifth step is establish a control flow / condition that takes in the randomNumber and assigns eightBall a reply to the userQuestion

## Create your own replies and use them in switch statements

## console.log userQuestion which will state what was asked, then console.log the magic eight ball's reply to see what the user's future will be!
